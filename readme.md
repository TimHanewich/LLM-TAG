# üïπÔ∏è **LLM TAG**: **LLM**-Driven **T**ext **A**dventure **G**ame
I designed and implemented an LLM-driven text adventure game, inspired and similar to the 1977 game [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork).

## How to run LLM TAG
1. Make sure you have the [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) installed.
2. Put your Azure OpenAI credentials (model deployment URL and API-key) into the [azure-openai-credentials.json](./src/azure-openai-credentials.json) file.
3. Run `dotnet run` within the [src folder](./src/) and enjoy the game!
